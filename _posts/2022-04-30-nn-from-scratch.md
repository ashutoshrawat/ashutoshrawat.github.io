I started learning machine learning and deep learning without any strong foundation. I went directly into the implementation, without properly understanding the maths. I would not say that it was the best approach, but it was effective. But, deep inside I always had this uneasiness of understanding completely the thing I was doing. This blog is my attempt to understand the maths behind the neural networks and build a neural network from scratch using python.
