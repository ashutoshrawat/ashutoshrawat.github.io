I am Ashutosh Rawat, a Machine Learning Engineer at Sparkcognition, working in the domain of renewable energy. I am interested in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve the real world problems. Before working at Sparkcognition I was pursuing my PhD from Columbia University in the domain of Computational Mechanics.
